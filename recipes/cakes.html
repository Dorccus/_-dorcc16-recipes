    <h1>Description</h1>

    <h2>This Smith Island cake has really tender cake layers 
        with a buttery vanilla flavor.</h2> 

    <p> A lightly sweet 
        ganache icing helps balance out the whole thing. 
        Prepare this showstopper for a special occasion 
        and receive rave reviews. Using aluminum pans really 
        speeds up the assembly and cooking process. 
        The batter holds well while the other layers cook.

        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients For The Sponge Cake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps To Make The Cake</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare icing: Combine cream and corn syrup in a 
            medium saucepan over medium heat; bring mixture just to a 
            simmer, stirring often. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Place chocolate in a large microwave-safe bowl and pour 
            hot cream mixture over the top. Sprinkle with salt and 
            let stand for 2 minutes. Whisk until completely smooth 
            and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. 
            Chill icing in the refrigerator until thickened and 
            spreadable, about 45 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare cake layers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees 
            F (175 degrees C). Grease nine 8 1/2-inch round disposable 
            cake pans with cooking spray. Line the bottoms with parchment 
            paper and spray paper lightly with more cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Beat butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment 
            at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually 
            add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. 
            Add eggs one at a time and beat just until incorporated 
            after each addition. Beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt 
            in a medium bowl until well combined. Add flour mixture to 
            butter mixture alternately with buttermilk in 3 batches, 
            beginning and ending with flour mixture and beating on 
            medium speed. Divide batter evenly (about 1 cup each) 
            among the prepared pans and smooth with an offset spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until a toothpick 
            inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 14 minutes. 
            Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then turn cakes 
            out onto wire racks to cool completely, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place 1 cake layer on an 8-inch round cake board and spread with 
            1/3 cup icing using a small offset spatula. Top with another cake 
            layer and spread with another 1/3 cup icing. Repeat the process with 
            remaining cake layers and icing. Coat the top and sides of cake with 
            a thin layer of icing. Chill cake in the refrigerator for 
            1 hour and reserve remaining icing.</li>
        <li>Place chilled cake on a wire rack over a rimmed baking pan. 
            Microwave reserved icing at medium (50%) power in 30-second 
            intervals, stirring between, until smooth and pourable, 60 to 90 seconds. 
            Pour icing in a slow, steady stream over the top of cake, starting 
            at the center and moving to the outer edges so it flows down the sides. 
            Smooth out the sides and fill any gaps with a small offset spatula.</li>
        <li>Chill cake in the refrigerator until set, about 1 hour. 
            Carefully transfer cake to a serving plate. Serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
